### How To Handle
1. Import the UniHandle from uni_handle.py file 
2. Create new UniHandle object where you wish the menu loop to sit
	Several launch flags are available:
		keep_open          | allow for CLI input past start args.
		include_predefined | add default clear screen, exit application menu items.
		show_hidden        | include items without a docstring in the menu.
		no_menu            | if you really want *nothing*, you can turn off the menu entirely.
3. Add your functions to the object 
	handle["key"] = function
4. Run the handle object
	handle()
